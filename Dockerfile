# The upgrade is not decoration. The published alpine tag is rebuilt on its own schedule
# and routinely trails its own repository by a patch or two, so a registry scanner reads
# CVEs off the base image that the branch has already fixed and blocks the pull over a
# package the mirror would hand us patched. Upgrading first pins the image to the branch's
# current security level at build time rather than to whenever the tag was last rebuilt.
