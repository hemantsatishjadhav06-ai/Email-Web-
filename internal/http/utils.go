// The revoked-key and licence mappings live here rather than one level up in
// writeServiceError because most handlers reach for this helper and nothing else —
// transactional notifications, custom events, broadcasts, automations, the contact
// timeline, message history, blog themes and web analytics all do. Mapping the
// revoked key only in writeServiceError left every one of those answering a dead
// credential with a 500, which is the case that matters most: those are the
// endpoints an API key actually calls. The licence refusals are placed at the same
// level for the same reason, and because writeServiceError delegates here on its
// first line, one branch covers both helpers — which is what lets the licence gates
// reach twenty-four handler files without a single handler being edited.

// errors.Is/errors.As rather than type assertions: services wrap errors on their
// way up — the authenticate step that sits one line above every permission check
// already does — and a bare assertion would silently degrade a wrapped denial
// into an opaque 500.

	// anything else as a fault of ours, so the 500 this used to be left every Zap
	// failing with an error its owner could not act on.
	//
	// One handler did worse than 500. transactional.send classifies its failures
	// by substring, and a revoked key arrives as "api key has been revoked: user
