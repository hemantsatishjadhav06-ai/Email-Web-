// production, rather than silently testing a build with no SDK at all.

// The bundle is a static asset rather than a //go:embed for a licensing
// reason: it links ua-parser-js, which is AGPL-3.0-or-later, so compiling it
// into the binary would carry that code into every artifact Mailwave ships.
// Reading it at startup keeps the licence boundary at web_analytics_sdk/,
// where its own LICENSE and NOTICE describe it.
//
// A missing bundle is not fatal, and deliberately so. NewWebAnalyticsHandler
// accepts a nil bundle and then registers no /na.js route, which is the
// correct behaviour for a binary run outside a tree that carries the asset —
// tracking is unavailable, everything else works.
