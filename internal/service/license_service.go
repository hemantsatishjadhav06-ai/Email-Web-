// It lives here, in code, and deliberately NOT in the signed payload. A key already in a
// customer's hands cannot be edited, so a grace period baked into it would freeze the policy
// for a year across every installation; as a constant it can be lengthened — or shortened —
// in a release, and the change reaches every deployment on upgrade without re-minting a
// single key.
//

// somebody installs a different key. The lifecycle state — active, grace, expired — is

//
// There is no ticker and no background goroutine. A refresh loop would buy nothing (the
