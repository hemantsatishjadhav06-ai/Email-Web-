// fullyLicensedProvider is the EntitlementProvider handed to the construction sites that
// predate licensing — the ones whose subject is something else entirely (listing workspaces,
// verifying DNS, blank integration credentials) and which must keep asserting the behaviour
// they always asserted.
//
// It answers an active Enterprise grant, because that is what those tests used to run under:
// before the gates existed every capability was ungated, and a provider granting everything is
// the only substitution that leaves their expectations unchanged. Handing them
// CommunityEntitlements would make them assert the gated behaviour by accident, which is the
// licence gates' own tests' job — see the licence-gate section of workspace_service_test.go,
// which drives its own providers.
//
// It is a generated mock rather than a hand-written stub so that a gate consulting the
// provider is visible to gomock like every other collaborator. AnyTimes, because these tests
// pin behaviour, not how often a gate asks.
