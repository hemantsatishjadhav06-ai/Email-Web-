// Licensing is decided per deployment — one Postgres database, whatever the number of API
// containers standing in front of it — and answered entirely offline from a signed key. No
// type in this file reaches the network, keeps state, or can fail: an installation with no
// key, with a key it cannot parse, or with a key that ran out is a Community installation
// holding exactly what CommunityEntitlements returns.
//
// Two rules govern everything here and everything that reads it:
//
// The absence of a licence only ever RESTRICTS. No code path may grant more when unlicensed
// than it grants when licensed — an installation that upgrades must never see a member's
// restricted permissions widen into full ones.
//
// Licensing never blocks the machines. It gates the creation of new configuration, never a
// send, never a read, never a deletion, never a login. HasPermission, the SES send path,
// endpoint and custom-domain resolution, the OIDC guards and magic-code login are all outside
// its reach, and the "never touch" list on EntitlementProvider names them one by one.

// Feature names one licence-gated capability.
//
// The set is a closed whitelist, never a blacklist: a key minted today must not silently
// unlock a capability invented three releases from now, so a feature string this build does
// not recognise is not a feature at all — IsValid rejects it and the gate stays shut.
//
// These values are the wire strings carried in a key's "feat" array and echoed to the console,
// so they are frozen. Renaming one un-licenses every key already issued, and there is no
// phone-home that could re-issue them.

// EntitlementProvider answers what this deployment is licensed for. It is the read-only port
// every gate consumes, and the only licence-shaped dependency any service takes.
//
// Entitlements takes no context and returns no error on purpose. A gate must be able to ask
// this question on any path without acquiring a cancellation, and there is no failure mode to
// report: an implementation that cannot read or verify a key returns CommunityEntitlements().
// Failing safe here means failing *closed on features* and *open on operation* — the
// deployment loses paid capabilities, never the ability to run.
//
// Implementations must never panic, never block on anything unbounded, and never return the
// zero Entitlements. Claims are parsed once and the lifecycle state is derived from the clock
// at read time, so the ordinary call is a mutex and a comparison. The single exception is an
// implementation retrying a stored key it could not read at all — that read is bounded by a
// timeout, rate-limited by a backoff, and taken by at most one goroutine at a time, because
// caching "I could not find out" as "there is no licence" would cost a paying customer every
// paid capability until somebody restarted the process.
//
// # Call sites
//
// There is no ee/ directory to grep, so every consumer of this interface is enumerated here
// instead. This list is the compensating control the plan owes for that absence, and the
// plan promises it is complete — which makes a stale entry worse than no list at all,
// because a reader who trusts it stops looking.
//
// So it is not prose. TestEntitlementProviderCallSitesAreListed in license_test.go walks the
// tree for consumers of this interface and fails when one of them is missing from the list
// below. If that test is red, the fix is to add the file here, not to loosen the test.
//
// Gates — the places where the absence of a licence actually refuses something. One entry is
// an inversion of that and is filed under Widenings below, on its own, because a list of
// refusals is exactly where a widening disappears:
//
//   - internal/service/workspace_service.go, CreateWorkspace — MaxWorkspaces (G1), refused
//     with *ErrWorkspaceQuotaReached.
//   - internal/service/workspace_service.go, SetUserPermissions — FeatureRBAC (G3).
//   - internal/service/workspace_service.go, InviteMember — FeatureRBAC (G3), only when the
//     invitation carries permissions other than FullPermissions. Accepting an invitation is
//     never gated: a colleague invited last week must still be able to walk in.
//   - internal/service/workspace_service.go, CreateAPIKey — FeatureRBAC (G3), only for a
//     scoped key. AddUserToWorkspace is gated the same way as defence in depth.
//   - internal/service/ses_discovery_service.go, EnableTenantIsolation — FeatureSESTenant
//     (G4), after the integration authorization check.
//   - internal/service/template_service.go, CreateTemplate and UpdateTemplate —
//     FeatureTemplateI18n (G5), only when the save ADDS a language or CHANGES the content of
//     one already stored (TranslationsWiden). Removing a language passes, an unrelated edit
//     to a template that happens to carry translations passes, and the send path is not
//     touched at all.
//   - internal/service/audit_log_service.go, Record — FeatureAuditLogs (G6). A gate of a
//     different shape from the five above: it decides whether an audit row is WRITTEN, and
//     refuses nothing to anyone. An unlicensed deployment records nothing and is told
//     nothing; listing, exporting and the retention settings never ask, and work on
//     whatever was recorded while a key covered audit_logs. The one row an unlicensed
//     deployment does write is the marker that says recording stopped (and, later,
//     resumed), so a gap in the log is never silent. The purge worker that deletes rows
//     past their retention holds no provider and must never be given one.
//   - internal/service/oidc_service.go, IsEnabled — FeatureSSO (G2). It answers "switched on
//     AND licensed for", and ensureProvider and ExchangeCode call it rather than restating
//     it, so every path that reaches the IdP is covered by one expression. This is the
//     narrowest gate of the four: it removes the sign-in button and nothing else. Magic-code
//     login keeps working for every user of the deployment — an SSO account always has a
//     verified email address — sessions already minted stay valid, and no console is walled.
//     internal/http/root_handler.go reads the same IsEnabled through a func() bool so that
//     the OIDC_ENABLED flag in config.js cannot disagree with the endpoint the button leads
//     to; it does not consult this interface itself.
//
// Readers — consumers that report the grant without refusing anything. They are listed
// because "where is this consulted" is the question the list exists to answer, and an
// unlisted reader is exactly as invisible as an unlisted gate:
//
//   - internal/service/telemetry_service.go, licenseTier — puts the plan name in the daily
//     telemetry payload. It gates nothing, it must never gate anything, and it treats a nil
//     provider and an expired key alike as unlicensed.
//   - internal/http/user_handler.go, GetCurrentUser — serves the grant on /api/user.me to
//     every console session. It is the only way a non-root user ever learns what the
//     deployment is licensed for, and therefore the single value the console keys off.
//   - internal/http/settings_handler.go, licenseResponse — serves the same grant on the
//     root-only /api/licence.get, and on the response to /api/licence.set so the console
//     repaints from the round trip that installed the key.
//
// Those two reach the grant through a port they declare themselves (LicenseStateReader,
// LicenseServiceInterface) rather than through this interface. That is deliberate house
// style, and it made both invisible to the honesty test below until it was taught to look
// for the CALL as well as the type. If a third such reader is added, the test sees it.
//
// # Widenings
//
// None. There is no place in the codebase where the absence of a licence grants more.
//
// There was one, and the heading stays so that its absence is a claim a reader can check
// rather than a list that forgot. ConnectZapier used to widen the Zapier key to
// FullPermissions on an unlicensed deployment, because the RBAC gate sat inside
// CreateAPIKey and would have refused the narrow scope. The gate now applies only to a scope
// the CUSTOMER chose (workspace_service.go, apiKeyScope); Zapier's scope is a constant of the
// product, minted through a path the API cannot reach, and is the same five resources in
// every licence state. A test asserts the widening has not returned.
//
// # Never
//
// Nothing outside the three lists above asks. In particular this interface must never be
// consulted by: HasPermission or any of its call sites; AmazonSESSettings.ResolveTenant or
// applySESSendingContext, or anything else on the send path; WorkspaceSettings.ResolveEndpoint,
// GetWorkspaceByCustomDomain or any other read that resolves a live tracking, unsubscribe or
// blog URL; magic-code login, which stays available unconditionally and is what makes gating
// SSO survivable; PauseBroadcast or PauseForCircuitBreaker; the MaxUsers seat check, which is
// never licensed; or any code path that deletes data.
//
// The audit recorder (G6) is reached from the HTTP audit middleware after a response is
// written, and from the retention purge to record that it purged; it is not reached from any
// of the paths above. PauseForCircuitBreaker in particular stays unrecorded for that reason:
// it runs on the send path, and recording it would put a licence read there.
//
// The OIDC service was on this list until the SSO gate replaced the console read-only wall.
// The wall is what the exclusion existed to protect: refusing SSO itself was rejected while
// the alternative was walling a whole deployment, because a login that stops working locks
// operators out of the very settings page where they would fix it. That reasoning does not
// survive the move — magic-code login is unconditional, every SSO account has a verified
// email address, and an existing session is a session, so nobody is locked out of anything.
// What replaced it is the rule directly above: the gate may take the button, never the login.
