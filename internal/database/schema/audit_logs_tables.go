// Audit log: one row per control-plane action, in the SYSTEM database only.
//
// The table lives beside workspaces rather than inside each workspace database
// on purpose. A workspace database is dropped when the workspace is deleted, and
// "who deleted the workspace, and what did they do in the week before" is the
// first question an audit trail exists to answer; rows keyed by workspace_id in
// the system database survive that deletion. It also means one migration, one
// backup, and a plain query for the root user's deployment-wide view.
//
// Rows are append-only. The guard trigger below refuses UPDATE and TRUNCATE
// unconditionally and DELETE unless the transaction-local setting named by
// AuditPurgeGUC is 'on', which only audit_logs_purge and
// audit_logs_purge_orphans set. That stops the application role and casual
// SQL; it does not stop the table owner or a superuser, who can disable the
// trigger, set the GUC by hand or drop the table. The guarantee is "the
// application cannot rewrite history", not "nobody can", and the docs say so.
//
// Shared verbatim by internal/database/init.go (fresh installs) and the v41
// migration (upgrades), so the two cannot drift.

// AuditPurgeGUC is the transaction-local setting the purge functions switch on
// before deleting. The guard trigger reads the same name; keep them together.
const AuditPurgeGUC = "mailwave.audit_purge"

// AuditLogsTableDefinitions returns the DDL for the audit_logs table, its
// indexes, the append-only guard and the two purge functions, in an order that
// is safe to run more than once. The DO block that attaches the triggers
// resolves audit_logs::regclass, so it must stay after the CREATE TABLE.
