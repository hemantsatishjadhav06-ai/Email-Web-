# fails on a 402. The harness detects that build and refuses to start.

# pkg/license/pubkey_dev.go is compiled ONLY under this tag, so without a target that
# sets it the file is never built by anything: it could carry a malformed key, or stop
# compiling, and the first person to notice would be whoever tried to mint locally. The
# same run also flips the end-to-end licence tests from their fail-safe branch ("this
# build does not trust the dev key, so fall back") to the real one ("this build trusts
# it, so verify the grant"), which is the branch that actually exercises minting.
