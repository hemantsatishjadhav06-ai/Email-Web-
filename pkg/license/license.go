// Package license parses and verifies Mailwave licence keys.
//
// A licence key is a single line, self-contained, and verified entirely offline
// against a public key compiled into this binary:
//
//	NFUSE1.<base64url(payload_json)>.<base64url(ed25519_sig)>
//
// Offline verification is the point. An installation never phones home, so
// neither a customer's network outage, nor ours, nor the eventual death of any
// licensing vendor can degrade an installation that has already been paid for.
// The price of that is that there is no revocation: a key is good until its exp,
// and that cost is accepted deliberately rather than paid for with a callback
// that would turn every customer's outage into our outage.
//
// This package is pure. It performs no I/O, reads no configuration, logs
// nothing, and imports nothing outside the standard library, so that policy
// lives in exactly one place — the caller — and this file only ever answers
// whether an envelope is authentic and well formed.
