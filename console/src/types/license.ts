/**
 * Licence types, mirroring internal/domain/license.go field for field.
 *
 * This module is deliberately free of runtime imports, exactly like services/api/permissions.ts:
 * services/api/errors.ts needs the feature names to label a 402, and errors.ts is the one module
 * that must stay importable without dragging the router graph into a test environment. Anything
 * here that reached for the api client would put that back.
 *
 * Two rules from the backend carry over to every consumer of these types:
 *
 * `tier` is DISPLAY ONLY. Never branch on it. What a deployment may do is `features` and
 * `max_workspaces`, so a plan renamed on the pricing page cannot change what any console does.
 *
 * The console never enforces. The backend refuses a write with 402 whether or not this bundle
 * greyed the button out first; everything here exists so that refusal is not the first a user
 * hears of it.
