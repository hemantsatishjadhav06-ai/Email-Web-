 * It is the console's only unprompted word about licensing, and it appears in exactly one

 * still works — see entitlementsFrom in internal/service/license_service.go — so this is a
 * reminder and not a restriction, which is why it is a warning rather than an error and why it
 * leads with what keeps working.
 *
 * There is deliberately no banner for an unlicensed deployment. Community is a supported way to
 * run Mailwave, not a degraded one, and a permanent bar across the top of a console that is
 * doing nothing wrong is an advertisement, not information. What a gate refuses, it explains at
