/**
 * Told to an operator who has switched single sign-on on without a licence that covers it.
 *
 * SSO is the one licensed capability with no control of its own to refuse. The other three
 * answer a 402 the moment somebody presses the button, and the console explains the refusal on
 * the spot; the SSO gate simply stops offering the button on the sign-in page. That is
 * deliberate — the sign-in page is unauthenticated, and an error there naming a licence would
 * publish this deployment's commercial status to anyone who loaded it — but it leaves an
 * operator who just switched SSO on watching nothing happen at all.
 *
 * So it is said here, in the drawer where they switched it on, to the only audience that can
 * act on it. It leads with what still works, because the failure being described is a button
 * that is missing, not a login that is broken: magic-code sign-in is unconditional, every SSO
 * account carries a verified email address, and a session already minted is unaffected.
 *
 * It lives in this directory rather than inline in the drawer because
 * src/i18n/locales/catalogues.test.ts exempts src/components/license/ from the eight-language
 * gate by path: the licence wording is expected to change once real operators have read it, and
 * translating it eight times before it settles pays for it twice. English and French, like the
 * rest of the licence surface.
