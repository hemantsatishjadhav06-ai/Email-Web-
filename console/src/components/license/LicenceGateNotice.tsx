/**
 * Shown above a control the deployment is not licensed for, BEFORE it is pressed.
 *
 * The backend still refuses with 402, and client.ts still turns that into a sentence — this is
 * not a gate, and it never was one: has() answers true for an unknown licence, so a deployment
 * that has paid is never told otherwise because the console was not told anything. What this
 * adds is the order of events. An operator evaluating Mailwave against the price list used to
 * meet a licensed capability as an error after pressing Save, which reads as a bug report; a
 * locked control that names the capability and the plan reads as an offer.
 *
 * It is a block above the control and not a blur over the form, for two reasons the call sites
 * depend on. A
 * deployment whose licence lapsed still owns the custom roles and translations it made, and the
 * backend lets it keep and remove them; a veil over the whole form would hide what is theirs
 * and contradict that promise. And the wording leads with what still works, the same way
 * SsoLicenceNotice does, because the state being described is a control that is locked, not a
 * product that is broken.
 *
 * One button, to Settings › Licence, for everyone. That page already offers root the key box
 * and the price list, and already tells a member who to ask — so the block repeats neither, and
 * never shows a "Buy" button to someone who cannot install what they would buy.
 *
 * It lives in this directory so that src/i18n/locales/catalogues.test.ts exempts its wording
 * from the eight-language gate: licence prose is expected to change once real operators have
 * read it. English and French, like the rest of the licence surface.
